# Gulp Foundation 5 Template

This is a Gulp template to start your own project using the Foundation 5 framework.

## Requirements

You'll need to have the following items installed before continuing.

  * [Node.js](http://nodejs.org): Use the installer provided on the NodeJS website.
  * [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/): Run `[sudo] npm install -g gulp`

## Quickstart

And you're set!
